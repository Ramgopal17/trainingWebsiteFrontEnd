      If your content is unstructured, you are spending too much time creating
      and managing your content. Structured content leverages your information
      management and makes your content a profitable IP for you. Having a
      structured content-based information system enables authoring in a
      collaborative environment, reuse, and automating the content publishing
      mechanism.
